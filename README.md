10. **Comparison of Sales Performances of Manufacturers Based on Cheapest and Most Expensive Models**:
    The queries retrieve the top 10 models with the highest and lowest average prices, allowing for a comparison of sales performances based on model prices.

## Data Visualization Dashboard in Tableau

I have created a comprehensive dashboard in Tableau that presents all the key insights and visualizations derived from the analysis of the car sales data. The dashboard provides a cohesive overview of the sales trends, patterns, and relationships explored through the SQL queries.

You can access the Tableau dashboard to explore the data visualizations and gain deeper insights into the car sales data. The dashboard offers interactive features that allow for further exploration and analysis of the data.
